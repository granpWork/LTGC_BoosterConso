RAW -> (1 - Geran) ONE BIG FILE (with the cleaner format) for ALL, then split
                -> FILE A: one file with vaccination details per company                     File A-Batch2
            -> FILE B: one file with VIMS details per company

            (2 - Geran) File A -> Add in previous batches then consolidate to one big LTGC file (generate error logs)
        Possible Errors:
        1. Same date as first and second dose
        2. Second dose date earlier than first dose
        3. Moderna - atleast 28-day gap
        4. AZ - 4-12 weeks
        5. 1st dose should not be less january 2021

        (3 - Lianne) File B -> convert to VIMS per sub-company (generate error logs)
        Possible errors:
        Email, Birthdate < 18
        Birthdate vs category
        Comorbidities vs category

Questions
1. Re-clarify how we understand handling of different scenarios
 a. Data uploaded and vaccinated by LTGC  - no action needed



 b. Data uploaded but with booking and status is NO-show
    b.1 - (IT) Provide OVT1_CompanyName.xlsx and OVT2_CompanyName.xlsx
    b.2 - (HR) Confirm if inputted patient ID is correct vs CEIR
    b.3 - (HR) Prior upload - delete Last Name, First Name and Middle Name columns
    b.4 - (HR) Send email to ZP containing the OVT1_CompanyName.xlsx and OVT2_CompanyName.xlsx
    ovt1_scenario2_2.1
    vaccination Stage = pending 1st dose
    Appointment Status = Cancel, No Showted, Rejected - (booked???)

    2.2
    Vaccineation stage = Pending 1st Dose
    Appointment_status = pending or blank

    2.3
    vaccination Stage = pending 1st dose
    Data source = 2nd dose
    Appointment Status = Cancel, No Showted, Rejected - (booked???)






 c. Data uploaded but no booking - only OVT1 and OVT2 to be loaded
    c.1 - (IT) Provide OVT1_CompanyName.xlsx and OVT2_CompanyName.xlsx
    c.2 - (HR) Confirm if inputted patient ID is correct vs eZconsult (manually) - unless with ZP report
    c.3 - (HR) Prior upload - delete Last Name, First Name and Middle Name columns
    c.4 - (HR) Upload OVT1_CompanyName.xlsx then OVT2_CompanyName.xlsx
    vaccination Stage = pending 1st dose
    Appointment Status = Blank



 d. No data uploaded in EZ - VIMS, OVT1 and OVT2
    d.1 - (IT) Provide Final VIMS Report for upload to HR Representatives
    d.2 - (HR) Upload VIMS in EZ
    NOTE: Failed records needs further investigation by HR - if needed, fix the error then reupload
    d.3 - (HR) Download all Upload logs and filter Successful - take note of the Patient IDs
    d.4 - (HR) Copy-Paste Patient IDs in provided OVT1_CompanyName.xlsx and OVT2_CompanyName.xlsx
    d.5 - (HR) Prior upload - delete Last Name, First Name and Middle Name columns
    d.6 - (HR) Upload OVT1_CompanyName.xlsx then OVT2_CompanyName.xlsx



PART 2
1. HR Reps will provide LTG IT the final count per company, following two options below:
    a. Encourage EE to click the interested button in EZ
    b. Manually call and confirm their EE's interest/confirmation

2. LTG IT to either create or request booking slots (depending on the site)

3. HR Reps to book their EEs
Clover and covaxin - not part of the drop-down
